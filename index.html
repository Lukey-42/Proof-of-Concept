    <h1>Website Development Process</h1>
    <p>
      Before diving headfirst into developing a website, it is vital that there is a plan for each phase of the process. Without one, the path will be long, messy, and disordered which will likely lead to a below standard website that doesn’t have what it needs to become mainstream. With these specific steps of the process laid out in an organized manner, there is some guidance and a solid plan, which I believe will help push companies further in their pursuit of success.

      <p><strong>1. Misinformation and Disinformation</strong><br>
        The first part of the process of developing a website starts with the ethical consideration of the information that is being presented to the user. Whether it’s online shopping, news articles, or a social media platform, the company always needs to be aware of what they are telling people. If they are aware that they are spreading false information, that is considered disinformation and is common with so much data online in these modern times. While it’s important for users to look out for this kind of stuff, it is also the job of companies to ensure that the information they are using is backed by research and unbiased sources.

      <p><strong>2. Content and IA</strong><br>
        By prioritizing the content and infrastructure architecture, the foundation for the website is set. Understanding the purpose allows for everything else to be built around it to complete whatever objectives are set from the beginning. These are basically the blueprints for the entire website that provide a good starting point.

      <p><strong>3. Systems Design, Engineering and Organization</strong><br>
        Once the main idea is understood and the general layout is planned, the next step in the process would be to design and engineer the website, bringing it to reality. A good system design allows for scalability for future growth in the company, security to preserve critical information on the company’s side and the user’s side and has an organized structure that provides easy-to-follow navigation.

      <p><strong>4. UX and Visual Design</strong><br>
        This is where the user becomes the main focus, with the designers ensuring that the website caters to people’s needs and keeps them coming back for more. The user experience is the interaction between people and the various features, whether it’s purchasing a book online or reaching out to the company through the “Contact Us” page.
